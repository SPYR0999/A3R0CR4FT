# A3R0CR4FT
THE Minecraft server for aviation enthusiasts!

Our server is made to run on Minecraft 1.12.2 with forge installed.

The [rules](https://github.com/SPYR0999/A3R0CR4FT/blob/main/rules.md) are simple. Here is an overview:

  - No griefing will be tolerated.
  - Be respectful with others at all times.
  - Before building anything massive, or starting a new airport or set of buildings, ask for approval on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/9sDKrX828T).
  - The admin's fortress is a private place that no one should ever go into (does not applies for admins).
  - Helping to build is highly appreciated.
  - Anyone who breaks the rules will be banned.
  - Notify admins INSTANTLY if you notice an infraction to these rules.
