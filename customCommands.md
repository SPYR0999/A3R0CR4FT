Here is a list of custom commands we created around the server to navigate without loosing ourself in this growing amount of aircrafts:

```
/trigger tpLobby set 1
```
> Teleports the player to the lobby.

```
/trigger tpMuseum set 1
```
> Teleports the player to the museum.

```
/trigger tpAirport set 1
```
> Teleports the player to the main airport.

```
/trigger melon set 1
```
> Gives the player the melon of POWER!!!


If you want command shortcuts to be added to the server please let us know on Discord.
If you want YOUR construction to be added to this quick teleport list let us know on Discord.
