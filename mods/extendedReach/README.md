**IMPORTANT**

Before installing the (extendedReach)[https://github.com/SPYR0999/A3R0CR4FT/blob/main/mods/extendedReach/extendedreach-1.0.1-1.12.2.jar] mod, install the (McLib)[https://github.com/SPYR0999/A3R0CR4FT/blob/main/mods/extendedReach/mclib-2.1.2-1.12.2.jar] file as any other mods.
Whitout this file, you launcher might not work and the game will be laggy.

When the (McLib)[https://github.com/SPYR0999/A3R0CR4FT/blob/main/mods/extendedReach/mclib-2.1.2-1.12.2.jar] file is installed, you can proceed with the installation of the (extendedReach)[https://github.com/SPYR0999/A3R0CR4FT/blob/main/mods/extendedReach/extendedreach-1.0.1-1.12.2.jar] mod.

You then need to go into mod options, find extendedReach and set the range to your desire (a value above 7.8 doesn't currently work on our server, we are trying to fix this).
