1. Go to the [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) download page and intall the latest version.
2. Go to the [TLauncher](https://tlauncher.org/en/) page and download it's free Minecraft version.
3. (OPTIONAL) You can make a TLauncher account to use skins (see [installSkinTLauncher](https://github.com/SPYR0999/A3R0CR4FT/blob/main/tutorials/installSkinTLauncher.md) into the tutorials for more details).
4. Open TLauncher and set your Username or account.
5. On Windows use the Windows key to open the search bar and type %appdata%. Navigate to .minecraft and find the mods folder (if it doesn't exist you can create one).
   On Mac go into [USER]/Library/ApplicationSupport/Minecraft and find the mods folder (if it doesn't exist you can create one).
6. Download the mods from the GitHub page and copy them into the mods folder.
